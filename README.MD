## Demo
For those who want to quickly launch it: [https://dataram57.com/PGP-tool/](https://dataram57.com/PGP-tool/)
Please keep in mind that even I can't fully trust the OpenPGP library/module, so I recommend running it locally and not through someone's website.

## Installation
Open the terminal, PowerShell, or cmd. Navigate to your wished installation directory, and paste the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/Dataram57/PGP-tool.git
    cd PGP-tool
    npm install --save openpgp

## Running
Just launch `index.html`. I would also recommend making a shortcut to this file.
