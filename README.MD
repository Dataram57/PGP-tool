## Installation
Open the terminal, PowerShell, or cmd. Navigate to your wished installation directory, and paste the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/Dataram57/PGP-tool.git
    npm install --save openpgp

## Running
Just launch `index.html`. I would also recommend making a shortcut to this file.
